### Apply now for one of the following positions:

| ID | **Topic** and short description | Duration approx.. | Area and Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Topic**: Building intuitive User Interfaces for patients and health professionals. **Abstract**: The goal of this thesis is to deduce intuitive design patterns for user journey and build prototypes. The null hypothesis is that intuitive user interfaces do not yield to a higher health service engagement of users. | 6 Month | Bsc, MscUX DesignUX Engineer |
| 2 | **Topic**: Mapping semantic annotations of health data to user interface design patterns: building semi-automated user-interfaces for health prevention. **Abstract**: The goal of this thesis is to map health data description to UI design patterns for higher usability. The null hypothesis is that reliable mapping of health semantics to user interfaces do not yield to a higher health usability of users. | 6 Month | Bsc, MscUX EngineerUIX Developer |
| 3 | **Topic**: Build a prototype TikTok-style patient engagement platform for better patient compliance of health behavior. **Abstract**: The goal of this thesis is to map health data description to UI design patterns for higher usability. The null hypothesis is that reliable mapping of health semantics to user interfaces do not yield to a higher health usability of users. | 6 Month | Bsc, MscUX EngineerUIX Developer |
| 4 | **Topic**: Using natural language processing to understand physician and patient communication in order to write discharge letters for patients and health professionals. **Abstract**: The goal of this work is to use modern natural language processing techniques to understand patient records patient physician conversations and other sources to summarize this information in a discharge letter of maximum 2 pages. | 6 - 12 Month | Bsc, Msc, PhD.Data Scientist |
| 5 | **Topic**: Implementing existing mental health voice AI algorithms for routine practice in general medicine. **Abstract**: The main goal of this work is to use existing algorithms and literature science and health care to bring these algorithms into a coherent platform for usage in daily routine care or supporting care inpatient applications. | 6 - 12 Month | Bsc, Msc, PhD.ML Engineer |
| 6 | **Topic**: Develop a syntactic and semantic data model for preventive care - supporting metabolic prevention through better data. **Abstract**: The main goal of this work is to integrate different data sources with different syntactic and semantic models into coherent overarching data model. The overarching data model shall be based on international standards like SNOMED and FHIR. the data model should be aligned to a specific patient journey of metabolic diseases, e.g. cardiovascular prevention. | 6 - 12 Month | Bsc, Msc, PhD.Data Engineer |
| 7 | **Topic**: Develop are completely digital consent platform for patients and healthcare professionals. **Abstract**: the goal of this work is to use existing hardware and software solutions for a digital consent platform. The digital platform shall be based on legal frameworks and regulations. The solution should entail connection to the German standards and international security norms. | 6 - 12 Month | Bsc, Msc, PhD.Service Engineer |
| 8 | **Topic**: A establishing a framework and the prototype for deploying a digital health practice for general medicine. **Abstract**:modern health solutions require a standard set of digital health solutions and products. These digital environments are predominantly based on modern cloud technologies. In order to be able to provide fast secure and scalable environments for health professionals in their private practices we require a new approach to deploy private cloud environments. The main goal of this work is to design A reference architecture for digital health solutions and provide a prototypical deployment strategy 4 an open stack and Kubernetes environment. | 6 - 12 Month | Bsc, Msc, PhD.DevOps Engineer |
| 9 | **Topic**: Deploying artificial intelligence solutions on edge devices in general practices. **Abstract**: The main goal of this work is to provide an MLDevOps environment to allow existing AI solutions be deployed on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson device. The solution shall provide health professionals with validated and marketed AI devices for their routine care within their private practices for more efficient care or decision support algorithms. | 6 - 12 Month | Bsc, Msc, PhD.MLOPS Engineer |
